# Interview Questions

adopted from Stephen Grider's course on Udemy

## Things you need

- Code editor
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
- Download [drawio-desktop](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/tag/v20.7.4)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Steps 🏃🏾‍♂️ to get off and running

- Clone this repo
- `cd` to the directory you cloned to
- If you want to run a specific test, run `npx jest <directory where test lives>/test.js --watch` for example you can run `npx jest fib/test.js --watch` to run the tests for the fib exercise
- `cd` into the exercise directory and run `npm run test` this command runs the tests for all the tests in the exercise directory.

This gives you 28 different questions to practice all of which I have been asked live interviews.

🍺 cheers!
